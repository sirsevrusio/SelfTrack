## Known Limitations

- Works fine on debian based linux operating systems and windows that supports python3.
- Windows Installation Scripts are added but not finished. Sadly no compatibility for linux(Arch, RedHat, Opensuse, etc) and macOs.
- No multi-user or authentication system (single local user only).

## Future Improvements (v2 Goals)

- Add cross-platform compatibility.
- Improve UI/UX styling.
